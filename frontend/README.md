# Frontend
This React + TypeScript app uses Tailwind CSS, lucide-react, and React Flow to visualize Kubernetes resources.


## Included libraries
- **Tailwind CSS** and **shadcn/ui** for styling.
- **lucide-react** icons.
- **React Flow** for the canvas.

## Running the app
1. Install packages with `npm install`.
2. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`.

The default page renders a Kubernetes Pod in a React Flow canvas. A ConfigMap and Secret appear as USB drives that plug into the Pod, while a Service connects via an electrified cable.
