# Frontend

This React + TypeScript app uses Tailwind CSS and lucide-react to visualize Kubernetes resources.

## Included libraries
- **Tailwind CSS** and **shadcn/ui** for styling.
- **lucide-react** icons.

## Running the app
1. Install packages with `npm install`.
2. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`.

The default page renders a Kubernetes Pod as a large square. A ConfigMap and Secret appear as USB drives that plug into the Pod, while a Service connects via an electrified cable.
