# Frontend

This React + TypeScript app demonstrates how several libraries work together.

## Included libraries
- **React Flow** for the canvas.
- **elkjs** to auto-layout nodes.
- **Tailwind CSS** and **shadcn/ui** for styling.
- **lucide-react** icons.
- **Zustand** for a tiny state store.

## Running the app
1. Install packages with `npm install`.
2. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`.

The default page renders a small React Flow canvas with two icon nodes
positioned by ELK. The "Reset Layout" button shows shadcn/ui in action.
